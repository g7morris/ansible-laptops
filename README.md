# Ansible Laptops

## Overview

This repository automates the installation and configuration of software on both macOS Sonoma and Ubuntu Linux laptops. Utilizing a combination of bash scripts and Ansible playbooks ensures that one's development environment is consistently configured across different operating systems.

All syntax, formatting etc is critiqued by the following in a Github Actions workflow:
* [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint) - checks playbooks for practices and behavior that could potentially be improved
* [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) - A linter for YAML files.

## How to Use This Repository

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine or to a USB stick to then copy depending on your setup.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/g7morris/ansible-laptops.git
cd ansible-laptops
```

### 2. Run the Dependency Installation Script

Before you can run the Ansible playbooks, you need to ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed on your system. This script will detect your operating system (macOS or Ubuntu) and install the required dependencies, such as Homebrew on macOS or APT packages on Ubuntu.

Use the provided [install_dependencies.sh](scripts/install_dependencies.sh) script:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install_dependencies.sh
./scripts/install_dependencies.sh
```

### 3. Install the required Ansible roles

```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --role-path ./roles/
```

### 4. Run the Ansible Playbook

After installing the dependencies, you can run the Ansible playbook to set up your laptop:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/setup.yml
```

This playbook will apply the appropriate roles to your system based on whether youâ€™re using macOS or Ubuntu.
