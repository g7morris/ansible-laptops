# The requirements.yml file should be processed before running your playbooks to 
# "install" all the Ansible Galaxy / community based Ansible roles as specified in the requirements.yml file. 
# This ensures that all necessary roles are available in your roles/ directory when the playbook is executed.
# This means "download" the Ansible code (roles) within this project structure NOT install to the laptop.
# After the roles are installed, you can then run your Ansible playbook as usual.
# Example command: ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --role-path ./roles/

# This file defines the Ansible Galaxy roles required for the ansible-laptops setup.
# Community-maintained roles are used to manage the installation of software to the laptop as defined below.
# Be in the habit of checking version numbers below as they will change over time.
